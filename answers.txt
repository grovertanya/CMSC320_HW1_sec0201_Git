Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: The difference between a merging and rebasing is that while 
merging, all the history is preserved and the existing commits stay the 
same. It doesnt rewrite the history and keeps a record of all previous 
branches. Rebasing, however, rewrites history and the commits get new IDs. 
The history will be cleaned and the branch will look like it was main all 
along.
